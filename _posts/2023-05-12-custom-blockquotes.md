## Abstract
Characterized by robust technical anonymity and a conspicuous absence of stringent regulations, the dark side of the Internet represent the less illuminated aspects of the digital world. This study analyzed a national survey conducted in the United States in November 2020 (N = 702) to understand the relationship between using the dark side of the Internet and misinformation beliefs in both public health and political context. With the help of propensity score matching and instrumental variables, the results reveal that the users of the dark side of the Internet are more inclined to believe the misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US Presidential Election. Overall, the findings significantly contribute to the existing body of knowledge concerning the social impacts of technologies that grant a high level of user anonymity while operating with minimal regulatory oversight.
