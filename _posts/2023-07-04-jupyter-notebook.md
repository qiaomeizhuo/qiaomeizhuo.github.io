## ABSTRACT
Social media narratives are considered crucial in shaping the attention of digital assets. The interactive narrative model posits that online interactions and narrative structures affect individuals’ attention. Yet, the conceptualization of narrative structure’s temporal and spatial dimensions and their effects remain limited. Furthermore, few studies have addressed how online interactions influence narrative structure. We construct a three-wave panel data for 1,226 active users based on 16 million tweets and quantify narrative circuitousness, speed, and volume using the Word2Vec model. The results of two-way fixed-effects models reveal that high-speed, low-circuitousness, low-volume, and emotional narrative increase transaction attention. In addition, narrative structures mediate the relationship between online interactions and transaction attention. We contribute to the interactive narrative model by formulating and quantifying the temporal and spatial dimensions of narrative structure.
